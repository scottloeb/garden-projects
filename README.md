## 🚀 Phase 2 Priority Planning

### **🔥 HIGH PRIORITY (Next Sprint)**

#### 1. **Feedback & Bug Reporting System**
```
Priority: CRITICAL for Dan's testing phase
Goal: Enable structured feedback collection

Features Needed:
├── 🐛 Bug Report Form
│   ├── Issue description (required)
│   ├── Steps to reproduce
│   ├── Expected vs actual behavior
│   ├── Browser/device info (auto-detected)
│   └── Screenshots/attachments (optional)
├── ✨ Feature Request Form
│   ├── Feature description
│   ├── Use case/justification
│   ├── Priority level (user's perspective)
│   └── Implementation suggestions
└── 📤 GitHub Integration
    ├── Auto-create GitHub issues
    ├── Proper labeling (bug/enhancement/documentation)
    ├── Template formatting
    └── Assignment to appropriate milestone
```

**Implementation Approach:**
- Single HTML form with JavaScript GitHub API integration
- Use GitHub Personal Access Token for issue creation
- Form validation with clear error messaging
- Success confirmation with issue link

#### 2. **Enhanced File Upload Validation System**
```
Priority: HIGH for user experience
Goal: Bulletproof file handling with granular error reporting

Test Cases to Implement:
├── 📁 File Type Validation
│   ├── Supported: .html, .css, .js, .tsx, .ts, .md, .json, .txt
│   ├── Unsupported: .exe, .bin, .zip, etc.
│   └── Edge cases: No extension, hidden files
├── 📏 File Size Validation
│   ├── Individual file limits (10MB max)
│   ├── Total upload limits (50MB max)
│   └── Progress tracking accuracy
├── 🔒 Security Validation
│   ├── Content scanning for malicious code
│   ├── Filename sanitization
│   └── Path traversal prevention
├── 🌐 Browser Compatibility
│   ├── Chrome/Safari/Firefox/Edge testing
│   ├── Mobile browser testing
│   └── Drag & drop vs. click upload
└── 💾 Error Recovery
    ├── Network interruption handling
    ├── Partial upload recovery
    └── Clear error messaging
```

#### 3. **Keyboard Shortcuts Debug & Enhancement**
```
Priority: MEDIUM (user experience polish)
Current Issue: Not responding in Vercel deployment
Possible Causes:
├── Event listener timing
├── Focus management conflicts
├── Browser security restrictions
└── Vercel hosting environment

Debug Strategy:
├── Add console logging for key events
├── Test across different browsers
├── Implement fallback methods
└── Consider alternative shortcut patterns
```

### **🔄 MEDIUM PRIORITY (Future Sprints)**

#### 4. **Backend Integration for Real File Operations**
- WebSocket connection to CLI backend
- Real-time project creation from web interface
- File upload to actual project directories
- Status synchronization between CLI and web

#### 5. **Advanced Project Management**
- Project templates with customization
- Dependency management
- Build process integration
- Version control automation

#### 6. **Automated Deployment Pipeline**
- One-click Vercel deployment
- Environment variable management
- Domain configuration
- SSL certificate handling

## 🧠 G.A.R.D.E.N. Cognitive Framework Application

### **Grassroots Approach (Structure-First)**
```
Feedback System Architecture:
├── Bug Reports
│   ├── Critical/High/Medium/Low
│   └── Frontend/Backend/Documentation
├── Feature Requests
│   ├── User Experience
│   ├── Technical Enhancement
│   └── New Functionality
└── General Feedback
    ├── Usability
    ├── Documentation
    └── Suggestions
```

### **Grasshopper Approach (Example-First)**
```
Test Cases from Real User Scenarios:
[Dan uploads HTML] → [Validation] → [Success/Error]
[User drags invalid file] → [Immediate feedback] → [Clear guidance]
[Mobile user reports bug] → [Form submission] → [GitHub issue created]
```

### **Sunflower Approach (Pattern-First)**
```
Common Patterns to Optimize:
- File upload → validation → feedback loop
- Issue discovery → report → resolution cycle
- Feature idea → request → implementation pipeline
```
