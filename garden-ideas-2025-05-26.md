**[MEDIUM]** Or… the longest germinating idea ever… what if we could co-develop via voice. And the output, instead of being an application… would be a stitched together audio file ready for editing… a podcast, if you will, with asynchronous inputs

**[MEDIUM]** MUST get back to my lawyer because I also must get Andrea some detail on when we might go to Michigan.

**[MEDIUM]** Spoon theory (nodepad edition)
- Tags: nodepad
- Created: 5/25/2025, 9:37:00 PM


**[MEDIUM]** I think it makes sense to start with 12 spoons. The attached two documents do a decent job of detailing basic demands (represented by number of spoons) in daily life. They’re somewhat gender- or context-specific, though.

**[MEDIUM]** for example: I’m a middle aged man with short hair. When I style my hair it takes very little time or effort. I don’t style my hair often, so it is unlikely that I’d identify with that task. Even if I were to style my hair for the most important event of my life, I doubt it would be a stressor for me at all. Generally in daily life I’d opt to wear a hat or just pretend like a bad hair day happened on purpose before I’d let it take 2 spoons away. I’m sure there are other examples in the attached that are easily dismissible, but that’s the one that jumps out at me.

**[MEDIUM]** There are also some examples within the documents that some folks would use to dismiss the theory entirely.

**[MEDIUM]** Example: many people find exercise to be energizing. Saying that it takes 4 spoons might not be universally applicable. Even if a person does use 4 spoons to exercise, they may think of that activity as “necessary” or “routine,” which makes the entire theory hard to relate to. Again,

**[MEDIUM]** There could be more examples like this, but I’m giving you just one.

**[MEDIUM]** What I’m trying to do is:
- Tags: none
- Created: 5/25/2025, 9:37:00 PM


**[MEDIUM]** 1) relate spoon theory more universally
- Tags: none
- Created: 5/25/2025, 9:37:00 PM


**[MEDIUM]** 4) articulate from qualified, unbiased, and peer reviewed research that neurodivergence creates the cases in #2
- Tags: none
- Created: 5/25/2025, 9:37:00 PM


**[MEDIUM]** For #5, the graphics do indicate that the daily starting point is decremented from poor sleep, illness, or missed medications, but they don’t give any kind of multiplier to the neurodivergent population.

**[MEDIUM]** If I’m trying to make assertions that are not research supported, please tell me.

### FEATURES


**[MEDIUM]** Features I haven’t thought about
- Tags: none

**[MEDIUM]** Can export results to start a new project (e.g video game, podcast)

### UI


**[MEDIUM]** Here’s another totally out there idea… I’m telling you about this without telling you what I’ve already built & backlogged… you’ll get all of that soon… an extension of the notetaking/brain dump app that has very different user roles: one which will be Zach just speaking and recording his brain dumps… and the other is me, actually building… wait for it… working video games

**[MEDIUM]** I’m a big fan of spoon theory, and how it creates a tangible metaphor for energy reserves/depletion. I want to use this theory to build an artifact that tells the story of how spoons are different for neurodivergent individuals.

**[MEDIUM]** 2) drive home the point that if you had fewer spoons (but the same spoon:activity values) or you had the same starting spoons (but higher spoon:activity values) you’d be exhausted more quickly
- Tags: none
- Created: 5/25/2025, 9:37:00 PM


**[MEDIUM]** 3) relate the two cases in #2 to the neurodivergent population (e.g., they may start with fewer spoons, or they may exhaust their 12 spoons more quickly)
- Tags: none
- Created: 5/25/2025, 9:37:00 PM


**[MEDIUM]** 5) show that (again, qualified, unbiased, peer reviewed evidence) in the neurodivergent population, re-establishing the 12 daily spoons requires a different and/or more intensive process than the simplified example shows (“you’ve got 12 spoons per day, and they automatically show up the next day in full”)

### ENHANCEMENT


**[MEDIUM]** need better names for the different apps and projects
- Tags: none
- Created: 5/25/2025, 9:35:15 PM


**[MEDIUM]** I’d like to be able to present this as a single slide in Microsoft PowerPoint (or google sheets) or as a single page (8.5*11) handout. Ideally, it would be more visually oriented (the lest text, the better), but it needs to be crisp, clear, understandable to the general reader, and most importantly, deliver the points from #4 and #5 while adhering to research around #3.
